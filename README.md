Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

OVERVIEW

The entire website is divided into four main section which are:
* HOME : The first page is the homepage which shows the overview of what other pages contain.
* EDUCATION: This section is about learning and test writing matters
* ENTERTAINMENT: contains different things such as gallery, music videos and jokes through which user can upload and download their favourite items
* TECHNOLOGY: This deals with discussions on Technology matters
 
DEVELOPMENT

page-layout.css: I used a single css for the layout of the entire webpage so as to derive thesame headings and footer style

Education, Entertainment, Technology:I re-write a specific style for this sections so as to obtain a unique style

Bootstrap: I equip the entire webpage with bootstrap so as to modify some changes such as font properties

Sass was entirely used to developed the technology page while bootstrap was used for the homepage

All other required properties as required from the assignment was used in entertainment section. such properties include:
media query, table, list and so on

The page is under construction as I am very limited with content for now.
