                <p>One day, two friends who were traveling along the same road together met with a bear. One of them was griped with fear and without a thought for his companion, climbed a tree and hid himself in the branches. The other one saw at once that he would not be able to get the better of the bear by himself, and as he had no time to escape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. He did so because he had been told that a bear would never touch a dead body.</p>
